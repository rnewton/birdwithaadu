981,US,WA,Grays Harbor,63,2024,storm-petrel sp.,Oceanitidae/Hydrobatidae sp.,1,"At 1007, at 124.9W while heading west into deeper water north of the west end of Grays Canyon (we were on the 47N line), several observers (BT, CW, RM) independently noted a dark storm-petrel approaching us from the starboard side with a flight pattern that was more consistent with FTSP than LESP.   As it neared the vessel, it turned to fly alongside at which time we got solid views of the dark plumage, buffy carpal bar, limited amount of white on the rump, and body shape.   We realized it was not a typical Leach's, and began to alert everyone on board to look at this bird and get photos.  The skipper, Phil Anderson, was able to pace the bird as it flew, so we kept it in view and close proximity for about 6 minutes, and RM was able to obtain some video of the flight style.   Viewing conditions were quite good, with indirect light due to the overcast skies, light wind (Beaufort 0 to 1) and low swell (4' from the west) made for relatively stable viewing.  Sea surface temperature was 59F.    BT notes from the sighting.   Noted an approaching storm-petrel with a FTSP like flight, but with unusually dark-appearing plumage.   As it turned sideways to us, CW commented on the interesting appearance and suggested closer examination.  I began alerting others, and made sure Phil was on the bird so we could stay with it.   Then went back to scrutinizing it.  The plumage was dark brown, with striking, broad, buffy carpal bars reaching the wing bend that were most obvious on the right wing as I looked at it from behind, since the inner half of the left wing appeared oddly scruffy and matted.  The white patch on the rump did not appear to wrap onto the sides at all, was fairly limited in size, and seemed a bit irregular and asymetrical.   Body shape was striking, as it was a broad, short-winged bird with wingtips that sometimes appear blunt, with a pudgy body, and short, shallowly-forked tail.   The legs did not project beyond the tail.  Flight style was consistent for the 6+ minutes we had it under observation.  Fairly steady flapping, with comparatively little gliding in comparison with the Leach's we had been observing previously.   No abrupt, darting changes in direction that are characteristic of Leach's.   The wingstrokes did not have the deep wingbeats of Leach's, they were shallow and more similar to Fork-tailed.","Westport Seabirds pelagic trip onboard the Monte Carlo.
